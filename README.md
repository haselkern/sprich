# sprich

The easy to use plaintext dialog format.

---

Compiles to JSON and is work in progress.

Notes:
* The start state is called `[+]`
* If there are multiple states with the same name, one is chosen at random. (Including `[+]`)
* Each `.sprich` file is a single dialog from a character.
* Empty lines are ignored.
